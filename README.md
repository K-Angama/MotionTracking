This application refers to the article, [Introduction to Apple WatchKit with Core Motion â€” Tracking Jumping Jacks](https://heartbeat.comet.ml/introduction-to-apple-watchkit-with-core-motion-tracking-jumping-jacks-259ee80d1210) by Eric Hsiao.
It collect in a csv file the movement and location data of the Apple Watch, that will allow the creation of ML models so that your Apple Watch recognizes movements using the Core ML framework.

The Application uses CoreMotion and LocationManager to collect the data and saves it to a file that is transferred to the iPhone using WatchConnectivity, then, you can export the data to a csv file from the iPhone.
